  /**
   * As background, let's start with what foldLeft and foldRight do. For example, the result of foldLeft on the
   * list [1, 2, 3] with the operation * and starting value z is the value
   * ((z * 1) * 2) * 3
   *
   * We can think of foldLeft as consuming values of the list incrementally, left to right. In other words,
   * we initially start with the value z (which is what the result would be if the list were empty), then we reveal
   * to foldLeft that our list starts with 1 and the value becomes z * 1, then foldLeft sees our list next has 2 and
   * the value becomes (z * 1) * 2, and finally, after acting on 3, it becomes the value ((z * 1) * 2) * 3.
   *
   * 1    2    3
   * Initially:               z
   * After consuming 1:      (z * 1)
   * After consuming 2:     ((z * 1) * 2
   * After consuming 3:    (((z * 1) * 2) * 3
   * This final value is the value we want to achieve, except (as the exercise asks us) using foldRight instead.
   * Now note that, just as foldLeft consumes values of the list left to right, foldRight consumes values of the
   * list right to left. So on the list [1, 2, 3],
   *
   * This foldRight will act on 3 and [something], giving a [result]
   * Then it will act on 2 and the [result], giving [result2]
   * Finally it will act on 1 and [result2] giving the final expression
   * We want our final expression to be (((z * 1) * 2) * 3
   * In other words: using foldRight, we first arrive at what the result would be if the list were empty,
   * then the result if the list contained only [3], then the result if the list were [2, 3], and
   * finally the result for the list being [1, 2, 3].
   *
   * That is, these are the values we would like to arrive at, using foldRight:
   *
   * 1    2    3
   * Initially:                             z
   * After consuming 3:                 z * 3
   * After consuming 2:           (z * 2) * 3
   * After consuming 1:     ((z * 1) * 2) * 3
   * So we need to go from z to (z * 3) to (z * 2) * 3 to ((z * 1) * 2) * 3.
   *
   * As values, we cannot do this: there's no natural way to go from the value (z * 3) to the value (z * 2) * 3,
   * for an arbitrary operation *. (There is for multiplication as it's commutative and associative,
   * but we're only using * to stand for an arbitrary operation.)
   *
   * But as functions we may be able to do this! We need to have a function with a "placeholder" or "hole":
   * something that will take z and put it in the proper place.
   *
   * E.g. after the first step (after acting on 3) we have the placeholder function z => (z * 3). Or rather,
   * as a function must take arbitrary values and we've been using z for a specific value,
   * let's write this as t => (t * 3). (This function applied on input z gives the value (z * 3).)
   * After the second step (after acting on 2 and the result) we have the placeholder function t =>  (t * 2) * 3 maybe?
   * Can we go from the first placeholder function to the next? Let
   *
   * f1(t) = t * 3
   * and   f2(t) = (t * 2) * 3
   * What is f2 in terms of f1?
   *
   * f2(t) = f1(t * 2)
   * Yes we can! So the function we want takes 2 and f1 and gives f2. Let's call this g. We have g(2, f1) = f2
   * where f2(t) = f1(t * 2) or in other words
   *
   * g(2, f1) =
   * t => f1(t * 2)
   * Let's see if this would work if we carried it forward: the next step would be g(1, f2) = (t => f2(t * 1)) and
   * the RHS is same as t => f1((t * 1) * 2)) or t => (((t * 1) * 2) * 3).
   *
   * Looks like it works! And finally we apply z to this result.
   *
   * What should the initial step be? We apply g on 3 and f0 to get f1, where f1(t) = t * 3 as defined above but
   * also f1(t) = f0(t * 3) from the definition of g. So looks like we need f0 to be the identity function.
   *
   * Let's start afresh.
   *
   * Our foldLeft(List(1, 2, 3), z)(*) is ((z * 1) * 2) * 3
   * Types here: List(1, 2, 3) is type List[A]
   * z is of type B
   * * is of type (B, A) -> B
   * Result is of type B
   * We want to express that in terms of foldRight
   * As above:
   * f0 = identity. f0(t) = t.
   * f1 = g(3, f0). So f1(t) = f0(t * 3) = t * 3
   * f2 = g(2, f1). So f2(t) = f1(t * 2) = (t * 2) * 3
   * f3 = g(1, f2). So f3(t) = f2(t * 1) = ((t * 1) * 2) * 3
   * And finally we apply f3 on z and get the expression we want. Everything works out. So
   *
   * f3 = g(1, g(2, g(3, f0)))
   * which means f3 = foldRight(xs, f0)(g)
   *
   * Let's define g, this time instead of x * y using an arbitrary function s(x, y):
   *
   * first arg to g is of type A
   * second arg to g is of the type of these f's, which is B => B
   * So type of g is (A, (B=>B)) => (B=>B)
   * So g is:
   *
   * def g(a: A, f: B=>B): B=>B =
   * (t: B) => f(s(t, a))
   * Putting all this together
   *
   * def foldLeft[A, B](xs: List[A], z: B)(s: (B, A) => B): B = {
   * val f0 = (b: B) => b
   *
   * def g(a: A, f: B=>B): B=>B =
   * t => f(s(t, a))
   *
   * foldRight(xs, f0)(g)(z)
   * }
   * At this level of working through the book, I actually prefer this form as it's more explicit and easier to
   * understand. But to get closer to the form of the solution, we can inline the definitions of f0 and g
   * (we no longer need to declare the type of g as it's input to foldRight and the compiler infers it), giving:
   *
   * def foldLeft[A, B](xs: List[A], z: B)(s: (B, A) => B): B =
   * foldRight(xs, (b: B) => b)((a, f) => t => f(s(t, a)))(z)
   * which is exactly what is in the question just with different symbols. Similarly for foldRight in terms of foldLeft
