  // Other signals
  // Multiple tasks like a queue
  // who gave the signal
  // What if something crashes who handles the errors

  // The needs is
  // can safely receive messages
  // can identify the sender
  // can guard against the errors

  // 3. Tracing and dealing with errors in a multiTheaded enc is a pain
  // we want o count the 1million numbers in 10 threads
