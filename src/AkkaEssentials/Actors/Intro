Actors


Traditional objects store their state as data and we call their methods
Actors store the data but the way we interact with them asynchronously

Every interaction happens through sending messages asynchronously

Messages are asynchronously passed
since real life physical messages take time too
think of it like sending a text rather than poking you friends brain
